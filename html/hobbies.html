                    <p>One of Jaryn's many hobbies is coffee. She currently works as a barista, and enjoys perfecting her latte art while on and off the job.
                        Latte art is, like the name suggests, an art. It is a complex process that involves steaming milk and pouring it on top of espresso in
                        such a way that ornate and simple patterns, such as hearts, tulips, or even swans, on top of the coffee. I found a very nice explanation

                    <p>Music is a huge part of Jaryn's life. She loves a wide array of artists across genres, including R&B, 60's, 70's, and various current artists as well.
                        She especially loves musicals. She has seen local productions, as well as in Des Moines, or even off-broadway in Chicago. If a musical exists, Jaryn
                        will know about it. In addition, she's been to various concerts and festivals, such as Hippocampus and Hinterland 2021.
