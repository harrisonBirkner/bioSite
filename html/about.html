                    <p class="umber-rounded-txtbox">Jaryn Froah was born on October 7th, 2001, in Des Moines, Iowa, 
                        to Matthew and Shari Froah. She is the oldest of four children, with one younger brother and two younger sisters. 
                        Throughout her life, she has moved many times. At the age of seven, she moved to a small town in Colorado, 
                        where she lived until she was twelve. After a two-year stint back in Newton, her family moved to Bloomfield, 
                        Iowa, where she first met me in September of 2015. Jaryn was homeschooled her whole life and met me through 
                        our local homeschool group. After fostering a deep friendship and relationship while dating over the next five
                         years, Jaryn and I got engaged! After the wedding, we will be moving to Des Moines, Iowa in June of 2022 with
                          our dog Bandit. Jaryn is a very artistic and creative person. Her hobbies include theatre, coffee, and music. 
                          She has been in various productions throughout her life, such as Beauty and the Beast, Pippin, and Alice in 
                          Wonderland, among many others. Although she currently works at a local coffee shop, her career aspirations 
                          are that she would be able to work in theatre, either on or off stage. Her music taste falls within the genres 
                          of R&B, 60’s, and 70’s music. Her favorite musical artists include Harry Styles, The Beatles, and the Black Pumas. 
                          One favorite way for Jaryn to express herself is through her clothing. She enjoys emulating styles from the 70’s 
                          and 90’s and infusing them into your wardrobe.
